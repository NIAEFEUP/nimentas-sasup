## Maintenance

This repository has 2 primary branches:

- `main` - the branch with the latest, stable version of the code. This is the branch that is deployed to niployments.
- `upstream` - the branch that is used to merge in changes from the upstream repository. The `upstream` branch should be merged into the `main` branch whenever the code is considered stable.

To update the `upstream` branch, you can [click here](https://github.com/NIAEFEUP/nimentas-sasup/compare/upstream...ttoino:ementas:main).
